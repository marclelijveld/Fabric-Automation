# Collect Semantic Model Documentation

Following the external tool Model Documenter [Webpage](https://data-marc.com/model-documenter/) / [GitHub repo](https://github.com/marclelijveld/External-Tools-Model-Documentation) - which generates semantic model documenation, there has been an ask for a solution that can refresh the information (as the external tool runs as a one-off). 
This Fabric-based solution provides a notebook that collects information of all semantic models in the defined workspace and saves that to a lakehouse. Based on that, you can continue to build your own documentation report out of it. 


<Mark >This is a first version of the notebook. Updates to be expected in the future. </Mark>
